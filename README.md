# Model Risk Management (MRM): Five Critical Human Interventions for ML Model Evaluations
Decision scientists should consider five critical aspects when evaluating ML models of MRM projects.

### Q1: ML-based feature reduction approaches are not always suitable for business strategy development.
### Q2: Use of macroeconomic, policy, and shock variables in ML model as "Control Vars."
### Q3: Less important features within multilevel modeling framework may be critical to increase model performance in production. 
### Q4: Detrending is critical when seasonal anomalies create a linear trend in time-series data.
### Q5: Use of statistical and ML-based models simultaneously to avoid modeling failures.
